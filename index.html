      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

      <p>
        I am Abhishek R S, a Second year B.Tech student in
Electronics and Computer Engineering at APJ Abdul Kalam Technological
University. I come from a family that values discipline, purpose, and steady
growth which are the traits that I’ve absorbed from my father, a train manager
as well as a retired army officer, and my mother, whose resilience and
dedication shape our home.
      </p>

      <p>
        My academic journey began under the CBSE
curriculum, where I built strong communication skills in English and Hindi, and
developed working fluency in Tamil. Early on, I found a deep interest in
technology and programming. By the end of high school, I had independently
learned Python and later earned an A+ in the KTU First year semester
examination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing is another space where I thrive. I’ve
contributed to several group projects and written technical and research-based
documents. Whether it’s breaking down complex ideas or leading collaborative
efforts, I focus on clarity, structure, and impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside academics, I enjoy working in teams, often
stepping into leadership roles to coordinate tasks and guide project flow. I
like taking initiative, especially when it involves solving real problems or
organizing efforts that bring people together. My teachers often describe me as
dependable, thoughtful, and consistently focused on improvement.
    
    </p>

      <p>
        At home, I share a close bond with my younger
brother, who’s in high school, and our pet cat, Pisu, who adds a touch of fun
to everyday life. Respect, curiosity, and a steady drive to grow these are the
things which define how I work, learn, and show up for others. I’m still
learning, still building, and always ready for the next challenge.
      </p>
