        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          I am Abhishek R S, a Second year B.Tech student in Electronics and Computer Engineering at APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University. I come from a family that values discipline, purpose, and steady growth which are the traits that I’ve absorbed from my father, a train manager as well as a retired army officer, and my mother, whose resilience and dedication shape our home.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic journey began under the CBSE curriculum, where I built strong communication skills in English and Hindi, and developed working fluency in Tamil. Early on, I found a deep interest in technology and programming. By the end of high school, I had independently learned Python and later earned an A+ in the KTU First year semester examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing is another space where I thrive. I’ve contributed to several group projects and written technical and research-based documents. Whether it’s breaking down complex ideas or leading collaborative efforts, I focus on clarity, structure, and impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside academics, I enjoy working in teams, often stepping into leadership roles to coordinate tasks and guide project flow. I like taking initiative, especially when it involves solving real problems or organizing efforts that bring people together. My teachers often describe me as dependable, thoughtful, and consistently focused on improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          At home, I share a close bond with my younger brother, who’s in high school, and our pet cat, Pisu, who adds a touch of fun to everyday life. Respect, curiosity, and a steady drive to grow these are the things which define how I work, learn, and show up for others. I’m still learning, still building, and always ready for the next challenge.
